# 🧑‍💻 Team Portfolio Website

A collaborative portfolio website developed by ENSIA 3rd-year Software Engineering students as part of *Programming Assignment 1*.  
The project demonstrates teamwork using Git, GitHub, and a feature-branch workflow in a modern Next.js environment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This website presents our team portfolio, where each member developed an independent page and data file showcasing their personal profile, biography, technical skills, and GitHub link.  
Each page imports its content from a dedicated file inside /lib and renders it through a shared MemberPage component for consistency.

The main page (`index`) acts as a hub that lists all members, linking to their individual pages.  
This modular structure allowed each member to work independently, avoiding interference and simplifying testing, reviewing, and integration.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. The repository was initialized and shared among all team members.  
2. Each member created a feature branch to add their own data file and page.  
3. Commits followed the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: add Ilyas data file and profile page`).  
4. Pull Requests (PRs) were created to merge features into develop.  
5. Peer reviews ensured consistent coding and correct imports.  
6. The final version was merged into main for submission.

## 🧩 Team Retrospective Analysis

### 🧠 Overview  

During the project, our main technical challenge was maintaining a consistent folder structure across all members.  
Since each of us worked independently on our own page and data file, a few differences appeared at first in naming and file organization.  
Some used lowercase folders, others used different placement for their data files, which caused minor import errors.  
We quickly standardized the structure and learned that clear conventions and communication are crucial for smooth teamwork.

### 🔧 Collaboration & Problem Solving  

Our decision to work with independent files made collaboration much easier.  
If a bug appeared in one page, it didn’t affect the rest of the website.  
We almost never faced merge conflicts because each member’s code was isolated.  
The only shared edit was adding links to the main index page, and even those conflicts were solved easily through careful pull and merge routines.

### 💬 Lessons Learned  

We realized that a **modular strategy**—separating each member’s part into individual files—was an excellent choice for teamwork.  
It reduced complexity, encouraged responsibility, and made reviews faster.  
By using feature branches, pull requests, and regular testing, we kept our project stable and clean.  
Overall, we gained real experience with professional Git workflows, improved our coordination, and understood how structure and planning lead to efficient collaboration.
